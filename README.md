# AAI521_SmartVisionAgri
A deep learning-based computer vision project for automatic detection and classification of plant leaf diseases using the PlantVillage dataset. Built with CNN and transfer learning to support early crop disease diagnosis.



🌿 SmartVisionAgri: Plant Leaf Disease Classification using Deep Learning
📘 Overview

This project focuses on developing an automated system to detect and classify plant leaf diseases using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and transfer learning.
By leveraging computer vision, the model aims to assist farmers and researchers in early diagnosis of crop diseases, helping improve agricultural yield and reduce dependency on manual inspection.

This work is submitted as part of the AAI-521: Computer Vision Applications course.

🎯 Objectives

Identify whether a plant leaf is healthy or diseased.

Classify the type of disease (e.g., Tomato Late Blight, Apple Scab, Corn Rust, etc.).

Compare performance between custom CNN and pre-trained models (ResNet50, MobileNetV2).

Visualize model focus using Grad-CAM to enhance interpretability.
